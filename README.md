## About 

The Dock is the premium e-commerce website where users can come to browse, save carts of and buy their perfect boat.
Users also received suggestion for other boats that they will like based on items they have in their cart.

## Usage

Users without an account can add boats to their cart, edit the quantity and items in their cart and checkout but cannot manage their profile or see past orders. If users want to sign up, we will merge their cart from their offline account. From there users can continue to manage their cart, see shops and purchase items with ease.

Logged in users will also be able to manage their past and pending orders and have access to status updates from their purchase. The Dock will send confirmation emails, as the status of an order is updated.
