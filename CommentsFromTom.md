Organization - Overall, I'm a big fan of of the fact that you structured the front-end based on component. Great job :)

Readability - There's a lot of inconsistency with spaces throughout (4 spaces vs 2 spaces) - you'll be happier in yourcapstones if you all agree to use the same spaces. Seems like a small things, but you'd be surprised how it can get in the way in the long run

Factories - try implementing a front end data cache in the future - it can help save you http requests and make your app faster! Let me know if you want to see an example of how to do this.

Security - Your secrets.json is in plain view! Make sure you remove it!
